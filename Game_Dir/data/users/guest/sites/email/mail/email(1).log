Hello newcomer. You can call me Cyn. I don't know why you decided
to get into this life, nor do I care.
All I know is that I was told to send you on your way.

1.1.1.1 - If you've got what it takes to lead this life, that's all you'll need.
I'll contact you if i need anything.
Don't reply to this address, I don't check it.

P.S: I have wired you some starting funds. Better grab you some code if you don't
have some already. I hear DataKult has some good ones. I attached a link.
