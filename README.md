	Allison Bennett(Lead Developer):
> Thank you so much for your continued support in this project. The feedback we have been getting has been wonderful. We are pleased to anounce that ExitCode has reached new hights, at a small price; This page, along with the entire Python version of the game is DEAD. The game is being activly developed over at it's new page: https://github.com/TheCyaniteProject/exit_code_java, and at the time of this writing we are activly publishing it to: https://itch.io. This page will remain here as a reminder of the humble beginings of this game. Some people have said that this game could turn AAA, and if that becomes the case, then we can look back here at where it all started. Thank you again, truely. A game is nothing without it's players. This project will last far into the future. I hope to see you with me as we create something the world has never seen before.
