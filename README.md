# exit_code_dev
Source Disclaimer: I am completely self-tought. My code is messy, unoptimized, under-commented, and probably used bad practices. - ..Don't hate me... Q.Q

Requirements:

	* Windows XP/Vista/7/8/10
	* Python2.7 (will move to Python3.6 soon) https://www.python.org/downloads/
	* Python Imaging Library (PIL) http://www.pythonware.com/products/pil/

Exit.Code() is a game about hacking. The plan is to take the best parts from my favorite games, combined with (of course) my own original ideas, and turn them into something great!

Here is a brief over view of whats to come, and what EC has RIGHT NOW:
(last updated April/9/2017)

You know how i said "Exit.Code() is a game about hacking."? Well, it wont be.

In the end, Exit.Code() will be, by all means, a computer/desktop simulator. The main attraction will be hacking, of course. But you will be able to do so much more.


	* Full Multi-Platform Support (Windows/Linux/Mac)
	* Realistic PC Desktop
	* Web-universe to explore (darkweb!!!)
	* Play In-Game Games (Game-ception?)
	* Attack, and team up with other players in multi-player, and connect with friends in the in-game social site (yet to be named)
	* Explore various in-game Apps/Scripts/Missions, download player-made ones, or create your own.
	* Take on randomly generated jobs, attack randomly generated systems, and collect information on randomly created NPCs, in a world that expands dynamically as you play.
	* Take either side of the law, or try you luck at playing both. ;3
	* Fully Mod-able (through source, or a mod API)


While we're still a long ways off from the final release (we're currently in pre-alpha!) we do have content already implemented, ready to play:


	* Supports Windows Only
	* Minimal PC Desktop (Looks horrid right now tbh.. but it works.)
	* (Some) Websites
	* (Some) Desktop programs, and download-able Apps
	* Fully functional in-game console
	* Custom player scripts (fully editable)
	* (Minimally Implemented) Randomly generated systems to hack, and randomly created NPCs to rob [>:3]
	* The game will expand Dynamically as you play; Systems/NPCs/Bank-accounts/Emails/Files will be created as you move around the "Internet of things"
	* Mod-able through Source-Code
